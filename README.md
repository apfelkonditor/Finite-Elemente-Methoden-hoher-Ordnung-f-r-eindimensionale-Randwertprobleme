# Finite-Elemente-Methoden-hoher-Ordnung-f-r-eindimensionale-Randwertprobleme

This project was done as a part of my bachelor thesis on finite element methods of high order for one dimensional boundary value problems.

The main functionality is located in fem.py, while main.py acts as a playground so to say.
Since I programmed this mainly as a proof of concept, and to plot some nice error-plots, do not expect any (let alone good) documentation,
even though I tried my best to improve my bad habits on this end.

This was one of my first 'bigger' programming projects, so do not expect too much of it. I tried out many different things,
and did not follow most best practices, those I attempted to satisfy later on, as i realized my code is getting unreadable even for me.

Anyway, if you still want to give this a try, the main.py is set up almost like a Jupyter notebook. You can comment and uncomment lines and observe what happens.
But be warned, I am probably too lazy to write any further documentation or fix bugs that might (will) be in the code.

Best of luck!
